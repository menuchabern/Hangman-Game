# Hangman

## Overview
This repo is for the software implementation of the classic game of Hangman. This software will allow a player to play against the computer, and try to guess the word that the computer randomly chose, based on the player's specifications. A description of this implementation is provided below.

## The Game
The computer will choose a random word that is not displayed to the player. The only thing that is shown to the player is the amount of letters in the word, displayed by blank boxes and an empty gallow. The player then tries guessing letters that might be in the word. Every time the player guesses correctly that character is filled in on the correct box. Every time the player gets a word wrong a body part is added on to the gallows. The player has 12 guesses. The player wins if they guess the whole word before the body on the gallows is complete.

**The full spec for the game is in the repo
